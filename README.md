# IAM Engineer Portfolio (PingOne AIC Track)

This repo is my step-by-step IAM engineering learning portfolio focused on:
- SSO fundamentals (OIDC/OAuth2, SAML)
- Web security basics (TLS, cookies, sessions)
- Troubleshooting playbooks for real-world SSO failures
- Preparing for: Certified Professional – PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud

## Contents
### Diagrams
- `diagrams/cookie-session-tls.md` — how HTTPS/TLS, cookies, and sessions work
- `diagrams/oidc-auth-code-pkce.md` — OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE flow

### Runbooks
- `runbooks/top-20-sso-issues.md` — common SSO issues (symptom → cause → fix)

## How to use this repo
I update this repo daily with:
1) a concept summary
2) a diagram or checklist
3) troubleshooting notes
4) a short “how I would explain this in an interview” section

## Goal
Become job-ready for IAM implementation roles (SSO integrations + troubleshooting) and earn PingOne AIC certification.
